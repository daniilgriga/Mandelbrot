# Mandelbrot

Lab work on programming from the ded32 course on optimization of calculation. As an algorithm of calculation I use the Mandelbrot set.
I have to measure the time spent on calculation and try to reduce it with my optimizations.

To debug the algorithm I draw the Mandelbrot set with SFML.

## btop++

**btop++** is a modern, colorful command-line resource monitor for Linux, macOS, and BSD systems. Written in C++ as an evolution of *bashtop* and *bpytop*, it provides real-time stats on CPU, memory, disks, network, and processes.

With a responsive UI, full mouse support, customizable themes, and features like process filtering and signal sending, btop++ is a powerful alternative to traditional tools like *top*.
