# Mandelbrot

Lab work on programming from the ded32 course on optimization of calculation. As an algorithm of calculation I use the Mandelbrot set.
I have to measure the time spent on calculation and try to reduce it with my optimizations.

To debug the algorithm I draw the Mandelbrot set with SFML.

## htop

**htop** is a terminal-based system-monitoring tool for Linux, similar to top but with a more user-friendly, colorful interface. It displays CPU, memory, and swap usage, along with a detailed list of running processes, including their PID, user, CPU%, and memory usage. You can sort, filter, and manage processes (e.g., kill them) using keyboard shortcuts.

In **htop** I looked at all the information about my system.
