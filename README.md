# Mandelbrot

Lab work on programming from the ded32 course on optimization of calculation. As an algorithm of calculation I use the Mandelbrot set.
I have to measure the time spent on calculation and try to reduce it with my optimizations.

To debug the algorithm I draw the Mandelbrot set with SFML.
